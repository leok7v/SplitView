SplitView
=========

SplitView Example in Cocoa

This code is based on my unsuccessful attemp to make use of
http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2009/09/nssplitview-delegate-for-priority-based.html

Turned out I needed a little bit more than integer priorieties plus some persistence.

But all credit goes to the original author.

Happy coding.
